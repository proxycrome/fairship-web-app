        <br />
        <br />
        13.2. You will indemnify Property Manager against any claims or loss
        relating to:
        <br />
        <br />

        ii. Property Manager making available information or Data to any person
        with your authorisation
        <br />
        <br />
        13.3 Access to the Data is contingent on full payment of the
        Subscription Fee when due. You grant Property Manager a license to use,
        copy, transmit, store and back up Data for the purposes of enabling You

        matter how caused.
        <br />

        providers of those third-party applications to access Your Data as
        required for the interoperation of such third-party applications with
        the Website. Property Manager shall not be responsible for any
        disclosure, modification or deletion of Your Data resulting from any
        such access by third-party application providers.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>14. Limitation of Liability</b>
        <br />

        all liability and responsibility to You (or any other person) in
        contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, for any loss
        (including loss, but not limited to, of information, Data, profits,
        savings, business or business opportunities, or goodwill) or damage
        resulting, directly or indirectly, from any use of, or reliance on, the
        Service or Website even if Property Manager is advised of the
        possibility of such loss or damage.
        <br />
        <br />
        14.2. If You suffer loss or damage as a result of Property Manager’
        negligence or failure to comply with these Terms that is not excluded by
        clause 14.1, any claim by You will be limited in respect of any one
        incident, or series of connected incidents, to the Subscription Fee paid
        by You in the previous 12 months.
        <br />
        <br />
        14.3. If any loss is caused by You or by a third party given a right of
        access to the Website by You, Property Manager shall have no liability
        for that loss.
        <br />
        <br />
        14.4. If You are not satisfied with the Service, your sole and exclusive
        remedy is to terminate these Terms.

        within 48 hours of them being raised but does not warrant that this will
        be the case.
        <br />
        <br />
        15.2 Support is not intended to deal with any questions relating to

        professional. To the fullest extent permissible by law Property Manager
        does not accept any responsibility for the opinions or statements
        expressed by its support agents. Without this limitation of liability we
        would not be able to provide this service.
        <br />
        <br />
        15.4 You agree that Property Manager employees will from time to time be
        required to access Your Data for legitimate business purposes, such as
        to assist You with a support query or to investigate or resolve an issue
        raised by You.
        <br />
        <br />
        15.5 Property Manager reserves the right to withdraw support from You if
        You send malicious, offensive or illegal support requests, or Your usage
        of the support service is excessive. The meaning of the terms
        “malicious”, “offensive” and “excessive” is to be determined at Property
        Manager’ sole discretion.

        <br />
        18.1 Any failure or delay by Property Manager to enforce any of the
